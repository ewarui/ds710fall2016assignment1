I find data science appealing because it’s multidisciplinary and can be used in a wide array of sectors. I currently work in healthcare and I’m really interested in using data science to help improve health outcomes.
I don’t have prior programming experience. However, I did do my minor in statistics so I used SAS- if that counts for programming. Also, I’ve created Access databases in my current work but I don’t have any training in SQL.
During my undergraduate, I completed my minor in applied statistics & data analysis. I took 5 statistics courses and used SAS in 3 of those courses. My final statistical course was in Regression Analyses.
